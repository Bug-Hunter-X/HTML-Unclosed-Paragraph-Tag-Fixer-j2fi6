# Unclosed Paragraph Tag in HTML

This repository demonstrates a common HTML error: an unclosed paragraph tag (`<p>`).  Unclosed tags can cause unexpected rendering behavior in browsers, affecting the visual layout of your webpage. The `bug.html` file contains the error, and the `bugSolution.html` file provides the corrected code.

## Bug

The `bug.html` file contains a `<p>` tag that is not properly closed.  This can lead to unexpected rendering and layout issues.

## Solution

The `bugSolution.html` file shows the corrected code with the properly closed `<p>` tag.
